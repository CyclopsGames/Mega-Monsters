	<div>You're happy that you've managed to get a Squiddo, and everything's good for a while. You have enough food, because Sleepon doesn't eat. (Your Sleepon gets all of its nutrition from sleep.) <div>
	<div>But one day, you wake up to find that Squiddo is getting bigger. And turning white. Heck, that Squiddo grew transparent. He's a ghost, except if you try to touch him you feel him, instead of your hand going through. (You know it's male, because females walk differently.) <div>
