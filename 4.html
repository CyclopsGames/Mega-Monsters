	<div>You have seen some Mega Monsters besides your Sleepon, but you've never been lucky enough to catch one, aside from Sleepon.<div>
	<div>As if on cue, one jumps out of some bushes. It's small, and you know enough about Mega Monsters to know that it's called a Squiddo, and rarely seen out of water.<div>
	<div>You stocked up on bait, however, and know that Squiddos like fish. You can lure it or run away.
